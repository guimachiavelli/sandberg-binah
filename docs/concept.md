> Binah is 'intuitive understanding', or 'contemplation'. It is likened to *a 'palace of mirrors' that reflects the pure point of light of Chokhmah, wisdom, increasing and multiplying it in an infinite variety of ways*. In this sense, it is the 'quarry', which is carved out by the light of wisdom. It is the womb, which gives shape to the Spirit of God.

> While Chokmah is the fuel, pure energy, Binah is the engine, pure receptivity

# First thoughts
What comes to me immediately is some sort of mirror setup, where one needs to move them to reflect the light towards the centre of the screen? It has been done quite a few times. Guiding the stream of light doesn't seem to translate the concept that well.

Conceptually I think the idea should be around multiplication, making multiples/infinites from one. Like a stream of a light that needs to be multiplied (so less reflection and more prism?) In any case, this idea of the "palace of mirrors" is really interesting.

Reflecting on the last quote: binah is also sort of the universal receiver, so perhaps it could be that the main mechanics relates to giving it as much input as possible (audio, video, keyboard, mouse). One needs to give binah as much input as possible so it can grow? And then translate that visually with the concept of the mirrors. It does loose a bit the thread of potential > wisdom > understanding of such wisdom.

What procedure can express the condition of palace of mirrors? Perhaps a better question is what procedure can express the translation of intellect?

The palace of mirrors as a womb for the light of god. Mirrors that reflect, multiply and divide the light.

# Ideas:execution, process, goal

* kaleidoscope: initial ray of light, refracts and breaks through barriers set up by clicking, get from point A to B

* rain: falling rays of light, input makes the receiving paddle wider which absorbs the rays and rays make paddle taller, once paddle takes over screen game over

* rain2: falling rays of light, input makes the receiving paddle wider which reflects the rays and rays make paddle taller, once paddle takes over screen game over

# Prototype

Controlling the paddle with sound actually feels pretty nice, especially if one sings or prays instead of doing random noises. Nothing forces people to actually do it, but it's not a problem (although the experience is not as rich interesting as chokhmah).

That aside, I'm again not terribly happy with the overall result. I am also wondering if things aren't a bit too simple -- though I'm now processing sound, there isn't much more happening besides that. After fleshing out the last bits of the mechanics (mostly win conditions and related aspects) there won't be that much more to talk about.

About the concept itself, does it work? I'm not sure. The multiplication is not direct, which could weaken the metaphor, but, especially now with the added blur, it creates a warmer feeling that reflects the womb-like charatecristics of binah. The verticality of the central monolith together with the rain of knowledge makes a very interesting and vibrating imagery and might speak better than what I am trying to say here with words.

The blur is also a big aesthetic departure from what I was doing before, which might be a good thing: the further away one gets from keter, the more recognisable and less "ideal" things get. By that logic, malkuth would be very much concrete, probably working only with photographic material or something of that sort.

Things to improve for tomorrow, the last day that I have scheduled to work on binah:

* add end game mechanics
* improve shader blur effect
* improve hit detection
* add small particle explosion on paddle hit?

# Recap
keter: pure potential, the connection with the unending that
chokhmah: makes wisdom and knowledge available, which chokhmah captures and passes to ->
binah: accumulates knowledge, nurtures it inside itself so it can be understood
